# üí≥ Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## üõ†Ô∏è **Project Objectives**
- Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using **Machine Learning algorithms**.
- Apply **data preprocessing, feature engineering**, and model evaluation techniques.
- Compare multiple models and visualize performance metrics.

---

 **Technologies Used**
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

---

## üìä **Dataset Details**
- **Source:** [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Description:** Contains anonymized credit card transactions.
- **Features:**
  - `Time`: Seconds elapsed between first and current transaction.
  - `Amount`: Transaction amount.
  - `Class`: Fraud label (0 = Genuine, 1 = Fraudulent).
